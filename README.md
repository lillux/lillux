## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Calogero, friendly known as Lillo.

### Dentist
I am a ***Dentist*** and a ***Dental Technician***, with strong experience in *medical images processing* and *medical modeling*.

Other than working in the clinic, I use *computer vision* and *machine learning algorithms* to produce 3D models from medical images, and then I 3D print them using *additive manufacturing*. You find my graduation thesis on these stuffs [here](https://github.com/lillux/Technology-in-Dentistry).

### Maker
As a maker, I have built and used many FDM **3D printers**, including *cartesian*, *delta* and *coreXY* design, and a *multi-material* **Tool-Changer by E3D**. I use CAD software and [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) to design parts and object, and I have used RaspberryPi and Arduino on some projects.

### Biotechnologist
I am graduating in ***Industrial Biotechnology***.

I have completed an Internship at *Center for Nanomedicine and Tissue Engineering*, Niguarda Hospital, Milan, that resulted in this [software library](https://github.com/lillux/morphoscanner), of which I am the *core developer*.

I have completed my master thesis project at [Ivan Zanoni Lab](https://www.zanonilab.com/), Boston Children's Hospital, Boston MA, working on *fungal ligands*, *innate immunity* and *vaccines adjuvants*.
